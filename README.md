*WebScrapBook* is a browser extension that captures the web page faithfully with various archive formats and customizable configurations. This project inherits from legacy Firefox addon [ScrapBook X](https://github.com/danny0838/firefox-scrapbook).

A web page can be saved as a folder, a zip-packed archive file (HTZ or MAFF), or a single HTML file (optionally scripted as an enhance). An archive file can be viewed using the built-in archive page viewer, with [PyWebScrapBook](https://pypi.org/project/webscrapbook/) or other [assistant tools](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook/wiki/View), or by opening the index page after unzipping.

With a running backend server, which can be hosted with [PyWebScrapBook](https://pypi.org/project/webscrapbook/), captured web pages can be further organized in the sidebar with folders, separators, etc.

A site indexer is also built in and can be used to [generate a static site](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook/wiki/Indexer) for captured web pages. Additionally, the [data folder of legacy ScrapBook (X) can be imported](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook/wiki/Import) using the indexer.

This extension is available for Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.), and Firefox for Desktop and Android.
