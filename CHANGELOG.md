# Changelog
* This project generally follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). For a version `x.y.z`, `x` means a major (backward incompatible) change, `y` means a minor (backward compatible) change, and `z` means a patch (bug fix). Few versions may not strictly follow this rule due to historical reasons, though.
* Versions before 1.0 are in initial development. APIs are not stable for these versions, even a `y` version can involve a breaking change, and only partial notable changes are summarized in this document. See full commit history in the source repository for details.
* Backend server requirement in this document refers to the version of [`webscrapbook` Python package](https://github.com/danny0838/pywebscrapbook) (or PyWebScrapBook).
